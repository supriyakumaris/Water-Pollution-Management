                    oceans, and
                    groundwater. This occurs when pollutants such as chemicals, oils, sewage, and plastics are

            ">Sources of water pollution:</h1>
                <li>Water is a good solvent. This is the reason why many different chemical substances are found
                    dissolved in
                    water. Gases in the atmosphere will dissolve in rainwater as it passes through the air. By the time
                    water
                    reaches a stream or river, it will contain a variety of chemical compounds dissolved within it from
                    the air
                    and from the rocks and soil through which it has percolated. These compounds may be completely
                    harmless,
                    naturally occurring substances, but they may also include pollutants.</li>
                <li>Pollution can be defined as the introduction into the natural environment (air, water or land) of
                    substances
                    (pollutants) that are liable to cause harm to human health or to animals, plants and the wider
                    environment.
                    Water pollution occurs when a river, lake or other body of water is adversely affected due to the
                    addition
                    of pollutants </li>
                <li>Water quality can be affected by pollution from point sources and non-point sources. Point sources
                    are
                    identifiable points or places, such as a pipe or channel, which discharge directly into a body of
                    water. This
                    might be from wastewater treatment plants, factories and industrial plants, latrines, septic tanks
                    or piped
                    discharge from barnyards and other places where livestock are confined. Non-point sources are those
                    where
                    pollution arises over a wider area and it is often difficult to locate the exact place of origin.
                </li>
                <li>For example,
                    fertiliser or pesticide washed from a field by rain may seep into a river or stream at many places
                    both on the
                    surface and through the soil. Pollution from non-point sources, also known as diffuse pollution,
                    contributes
                    most of the contaminants in rivers and lakes. Other non-point sources are pollution from
                    construction sites and
                    other land disturbances. The problems in identifying the exact point of origin make non-point
                    sources much more
                    difficult to control.</li>

            <p class="text">In April 2022, several images of dead fish floating in the Banganga tank, located in
                Mumbai’s Malabar hill area, circulated on news sites and social media platforms. Clean up efforts were
                initiated after locals observed the dead fish in the tank and informed the Brihanmumbai Municipal
                Corporation (BMC). The contractor appointed for the clean-up claimed that four trucks of fish were
                removed from the site. Officials speculated that the loss of oxygen was the likely cause of the mass
                fish deaths.


            </p>
            <p class="text">This is not the first time that such an incident has occurred. Mass fish death in the
                Banganga tank has
                been labelled an “annual tragedy” in previous years. One key cause that has been identified for the fish
                deaths is people putting large quantities of food in the water as part of religious rituals.

            </p>
            <p class="text"> In a separate case, more recently, a huge number of fish were found dead in a
                five-kilometre upstream
                stretch of the Najafgarh drain along the Delhi-Haryana border. Initial reports speculate that these
                deaths could be because of fertiliser pollution in the river which cause algal blooms that in turn
                deplete the water of oxygen, killing aquatic life.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Numerous ponds, lakes and other water bodies across India have been sites of mass deaths of fish and
                other aquatic species. The chief cause of this phenomenon is water pollution, most often stemming from
                anthropogenic activities.</p>

            <p class="text">Water pollution is a very damaging problem which the world is facing now. It happens when
                water pollutants like untreated waste and all release into the water bodies. Thereby, damaging our water
                bodies and dropping the quality of water. When the water gets polluted, it can destroy plants and
                animals. Not only does it affect the plants and animals inhabiting the water but also human beings and
                other organisms who consume this water. Thus, these water pollutants are very damaging and need to be
                managed properly.

            <h2>List of Water Pollutants:</h2>
            </p>
            <p class="text"> We can mainly divide the water pollutants into four types which are
            <ul class="bottom_ul">
                <li>
                    Pathogens
                    <br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Organic materials <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inorganic compounds <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Macroscopic pollutants <br>

                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h2> Pathogens</h2>
            <p class="text">

                When we say pathogen, we refer to bacteria, viruses, protozoa and more. For instance, bacteria are a
                very common pathogen found in water. However, when the amount of bacteria starts increasing, then it can
                heavily contaminate the water. The two most common pathogenic bacteria include coliform and E Coli
                bacteria.

                The other pathogens can be detected with the help of coliforms as they exist in the environment within a
                safe limit. But, if and when the number starts multiplying, they can pose a great threat to the health
                of our environment. Similarly, when there is E Coli present in the water, it means human or animal waste
                has made the water unclean.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Organic Material
            </h2>
            <p class="text">
                Organic materials are made up of molecules with carbon in them. MTBE (methyl tert-butyl) is quite a
                common
                volatile organic chemical. We used to use MTBE as an air-cleaning gas additive earlier. However, it was
                banned later but the time to erase it completely from water is quite long.

                Similarly, the water which contains organic materials can result in deadly diseases like tumors in the
                testicles, leukemia, thyroid glands and kidneys, lymphoma, and more.

            </p>
            <h2>

                Inorganic Material </h2>
            <p class="text">
                While inorganic materials might not be that harmful in small absorptions, but when they mix in the
                water,
                they can be dangerous water pollutants. For instance, heavy metals including copper, arsenic, barium,
                mercury, zinc, mercury and more are inorganic materials.

                It can be caused due to leaching from waste disposal, industrial accidents or even increased levels of
                human
                activities. Moreover, this type of water pollution causes very austere health problems not only in
                humans
                but other organisms as well. Similarly, if it is found in higher concentrations, it can be very deadly
                too.

            </p>
            <h2>

                Macroscopic Pollutants
            </h2>
            <p class="text">
                These types of pollutants are very easy to spot in the water due to their large size and visibility.
                The
                most common example of this is the trash including plastic waste that ends up in the water. As plastic
                does
                not decompose, humans dump it in water illegally.

                Due to their non-biodegradable nature, they end up collecting in oceans and other water bodies. This is
                a
                very severe problem causing the ‘great pacific garbage patch’ which can be compared to the size of
                France.

                Similarly, other types of these pollutants are small plastic pellets, metal, pieces of wood, shipping
                containers, shipwrecks and more.

                However, we need to understand that we can manage the disposal of these pollutants easily. It is not
                only
                destroying our aquatic ecosystems but also contaminating the water greatly. Everyone must come together
                to
                take strict action to save mankind and our earth.

            <p class="text">Since we have understood the concept of water pollution, let us look into some of the
                actions taken to control water pollution. Prevention and control of water pollution could be done in so
                many ways. To start off, it is to plant more trees around water bodies as they naturally help to
                assimilate and recycle the pollutants. Some important points are summarized below.

            <ul class="bottom_ul x ">
                <li>
                    There is a plant known as ‘Water Hyacinth’ that absorbs dissolved toxic substances like cadmium and
                    mercury from water bodies, thus actively removing pollutants from water.


                </li>
                <li>
                    It is important to dispose-off waste carefully and not to dump it directly into water bodies,
                    without proper waste treatment.


                </li>
                <li>
                    Industries should treat their wastes carefully before disposing of chemicals and other materials
                    into water bodies directly. Sewage treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants in industries
                    are established to treat the water used so it can be safely mixed into the river streams. It also
                    enables water recycling <br>

            <p class="text">Water pollution is a very damaging problem which the world is facing now. It happens when
                water pollutants like untreated waste and all release into the water bodies. Thereby, damaging our water
                bodies and dropping the quality of water. When the water gets polluted, it can destroy plants and
                animals. Not only does it affect the plants and animals inhabiting the water but also human beings and
                other organisms who consume this water. Thus, these water pollutants are very damaging and need to be
                managed properly.

                Since August 2019, the Indian government has been working with the states to carry out the Jal Jeevan
                Mission (JJM), which aims to provide drinkable tap water to every rural home in India by 2024, including
                those in habitations where the water quality is poor.

                Children are especially sensitive to water-borne diseases and contamination in drinking water. A
                particular effort was started in 2020 to make the provision of potable tap water supply in schools,
                Anganwadi centres, ashram shalas, etc. on a priority basis.

                As a result, 8.52 lakh (83%) schools and 8.76 lakh (78.4%) Anganwadi centres across the country now have
                access to tap water.
